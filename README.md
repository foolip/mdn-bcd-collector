# MDN browser-compat-data collector

Data collection service for MDN's [browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data). Live at https://mdn-bcd-collector.appspot.com/.

Feature detection tests are generated based on machine readable data (Web IDL and CSS definitions) from web standards, with support for custom tests where needed. Results are submitted to the [mdn-bcd-results](https://github.com/foolip/mdn-bcd-results) repository.

See [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) for details of how this service works.

## Setup

```sh
npm install
```

## Updating BCD using the results

Given a checkout of [BCD](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) at `../browser-compat-data` and a checkout of [collector results](https://github.com/foolip/mdn-bcd-results) at `../mdn-bcd-results`, `npm run update-bcd` can be used to update existing BCD entries.

If you have results from a browser not yet in BCD, first add the release in `../browser-compat-data/browsers/`. This is because the full version (from the `User-Agent` header) is mapped to BCD browser release as part of the processing.

Updating all data:

```sh
npm run update-bcd
```

The `--browser` argument can be used to only update data for one or more browsers:

```sh
npm run update-bcd -- --browser=safari --browser=safari_ios
```

The `--release` arguments can be used to only update data for a specific browser release, e.g., Firefox 84:

```sh
npm run update-bcd -- --browser=firefox --release=84
```

This will only make changes that set either `version_added` or `version_removed` to "84".

### Custom ranged version format

When the results don't have enough data to determine an exact version, ranges which aren't valid in BCD may be added:

- "≤N" for any release, not just the ranged versions allowed by BCD.
- "M> ≤N" when a feature is _not_ in M and _is_ in N, but there are releases between the two for which support is unknown.

In both cases, the uncertainty has to be resolved by hand before submitting the data to BCD.

## Running the server locally

```sh
npm run start-dev
```

(`start-dev`, as opposed to `start`, will automatically rebuild the tests and reload the server on file changes.)

## Deploying to App Engine

```sh
npm run deploy
```

This step is performed automatically when the `main` branch is updated:

- https://staging-dot-mdn-bcd-collector.appspot.com/ is always deployed.
- https://mdn-bcd-collector.appspot.com/ is deployed when the version in `package.json` is bumped

## Running tests via Selenium WebDriver

To test using the latest deployed version, run:

```sh
npm run selenium
```

In `secrets.json`, configure your Selenium remote(s) by the service name as the key, and the URL as the value (ex. `"browserstack": "https://USERNAME:KEY@hub-cloud.browserstack.com/wd/hub"`). Please check with your CT on how to configure your WebDriver URL.

You can also limit the browsers to test by defining browsers as arguments:

```sh
npm run selenium chrome
npm run selenium edge ie
```

## Running the unit tests and linter

```sh
npm test
```

Code coverage reports can be viewed in a browser by running:

```sh
npm run coverage
```

## Cleaning up generated files

```sh
npm run clean
```
