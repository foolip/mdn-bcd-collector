# MDN browser-compat-data collector

This service is part of an effort to
[assist BCD updates with automation](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/3308),
and exists to run lots of small tests in browsers to determine the support
status of a feature in a browser, and export those results to the
[mdn-bcd-results](https://github.com/foolip/mdn-bcd-results) repository.

See [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) for details of how this service works.

## Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

Before you can run or deploy, copy `secrets.sample.json` to `secrets.json`.

(The tests can be run without a `secrets.json`.)

## Running locally

```sh
npm start
```

## Deploying to App Engine

```sh
npm run deploy
```

(This step is performed automatically when a commit is pushed to `main`.)

## Run tests via Selenium WebDriver

To test using the latest deployed version, run:

```sh
npm run selenium
```

You must configure your Selenium remote in `secrets.json`; local environments
are not supported.  You may use any testing service, such as SauceLabs,
BrowserStack, LambdaTest, etc. -- please check with your provider on how to
configure your WebDriver URL.

You can also test just a single browser by defining the `BROWSER` environment variable:

```sh
BROWSER=chrome npm run selenium
```

## Running the unit tests and linter

```sh
npm test
```

Code coverage reports can be viewed in a browser by running:

```sh
npm run coverage
```

## Cleanup generated files

```sh
npm run clean
```
